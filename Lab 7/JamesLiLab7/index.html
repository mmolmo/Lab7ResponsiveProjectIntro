      <h2>About the Superb Fairywren</h2>
      
      <p>The superb fairywren is a bird in the wren family. It is a species of fairywren birds, which are found in parts of southern Australia and New Guinea. 
        Superb fairy wrens specifically are found across areas of south-eastern Australia. These birds are active during the day. 
        They spend most of the time foraging on spots of open ground near a shelter, which consists of dense foliage. 
        They typically fly for short bursts rather than for extended periods of time, and move on the ground with a series of hopping movements.</p>
